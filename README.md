# Neural-Likelihood-Function
2) (Based on problem 14.2) We assume a population of 9 independent Poisson neurons with Gaussian tuning curves and preferred orientations from -40 to 40 in steps of 10. The tuning curve parameters have values g=1, b=0, and sigma_tc=20.

a) Draw the tuning curves.

b) A stimulus s=0 is presented to this population. What is the probability that all neurons stay silent?
i) compute analytically;
ii) show by simulation that the analytical result is correct: Simulate the neuronal responses for s=0 on a very large number of trials. Count the number of trials on which all neurons were silent. The ratio of this number to the total number of trials should be equal to what you found in (i).

c) Repat (a) & (b) for g = 10. Explain conceptually why you obtain a very different result here.
